    ## Task Descriptions

    ### Task 1: Array Manipulation
    - Created a JavaScript file called 'arrayManipulation.js'.
    - Added a function called 'processArray' that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
    
    ### Task 2: Format Array Strings
    - Added a function called 'formatArrayStrings' to the 'arrayManipulation.js' file.
    - The function takes two arrays as arguments. That is, an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by 'processArray' function.
    - The function modifies each strings based on its corresponding number. That is, it capitalizes the entire string if the number is even and convert it to lowercase when the number is odd.
    

    ### Task 3: User Information
    - Created a file 'userInfo.js'.
    - Added a function called 'createUserProfiles' that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
